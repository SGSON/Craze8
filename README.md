# Person to Project Matching System Vision Statement

The Person to Project Matching System (PPMS) will be used to allow skilled members of the public to find relevant projects that are suitable for their interests and skills, and for project owners to select users who skills match their needs.

What makes this application different is that it is designed to remove(or reduce) bias through the hiring process. When a project owner reviews candidates that meet their criteria and have expressed interest in the project, the project owneer is presented with qualifications and skills with no personal identifying information (no name, age, sex, race or even a picture of a candidate that could cause even unconcious bias). Project owers will simply review qualifications. 

With the greatest respect, the late Martin Luther King Junrior (in his famous speach) stated “I have a dream that a person would be judged by the content of their character and not an outward bias”(paraphrased) 

Similar to matchmaking apps such as Tinder, the system will attempt to pair people with project owners that share the same interests and skills listed. Every user of the system will be required to fill out a survey indicating these attributes. The survey will be used in the matchmaking process.

The system is designed to be used by skilled members of the public and project owners. For project owners, the system will augment and replace existing methods of finding skilled people, such as job banks and social networking communities such as LinkedIn. General users can view the list of projects and express interest in those that they would be like to join.

All persons who express interest in a project will be assigned a matchmaking score and those with the highest scores will be recommended to project owners. Project owners can then choose the person of their preference, and swipe to select users recommended to them or move on in their search. Users selected by a project owner will be notified of their selection immediately.

Since the system will be used primarily for matchmaking rather than project management, it does not need to support common project management features such as scheduling, reporting, and file sharing tools. It will, however, need to maintain a catalogue of all projects and the candidates and project owners who have been associated with every project in the past and present.

The use of a matchmaking system for skilled members of the public and project owners is an improvement over current systems as it provides an intuitive interface and the matchmaking format has proven to be successful for other domains. Because this system will be designed exclusively for matching people to projects, users will be able to more quickly find the people and projects that they want than using other social networking apps.

The system will be considered successful if both project owners and users prefer using this system over other networking tools, based on a survey given to people after demonstration of the system.
