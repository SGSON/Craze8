# Person to Project Matching System Vision Statement

The Person to Project Matching System (PPMS) will be used to allow skilled candidates to find relevant projects that are suitable for their interests and skills, and for project owners to select candidates desirable for their needs. Similar to matchmaking apps such as Tinder, the system will attempt to pair people with project owners that share the same interests and skills listed. Every user of the system will be required to fill out a survey indicating said skills and interests.

The system is designed to be used by skilled professionals and job-seekers. For project owners, the system will augment and replace existing methods of finding skilled people, such as job banks and social networking communities such as LinkedIn. Job seekers can view the list of projects and express interest in those that they would be like to join.

All persons who express interest in a project will be assigned a matchmaking score and those with the highest scores will be recommended to project owners. Project owners can then choose the person of their preference, and swipe to select users recommended to them or move on in their search. Users selected by a project owner will be notified of their selection.

Since the system will be used primarily for matchmaking rather than project management, it does not need to support common project management features such as scheduling, reporting, and file sharing tools. It will, however, need to maintain a list of all projects and the candidates and project owners who have been associated with every project in the past and present.

The use of a matchmaking system for skilled candidates and project owners is an improvement over current systems as it provides an intuitive interface to find people unlike some online systems. Because this system will be designed exclusively for matching people to projects, users will be able to more quickly find the people and projects that they want.

The system will be considered successful if both project owners and users prefer using this system over other networking tools, based on a survey given to people after demonstration of the system.
