# Person to Project Matching System Vision Statement

The Person to Project Matching System (PPMS) will be used to allow skilled members of the public to find relevant projects that are suitable for their interests and skills, and for project owners to select users based solely on the skills and qualifications that match their needs.

What makes this application different is that it is designed to remove(or reduce) bias through the hiring process. When a project owner reviews candidates that meet their criteria and have expressed interest in the project, the project owner is presented with qualifications and skills with no personal identifying information. The information provided to the project owner is explicitly skill and qualification related, the project owner cannot view the name, age, sex, race or even a photo of the candidate, project owers will simply review qualifications and this will help them to determine which candidates they feel would be the strongest asset for their project. 

With the greatest respect, the late Martin Luther King Jr (in his famous speech "I have a dream") that his dream was that a person would be judged by the content of their character and not an outward judgement/bias. This is the type of bias we hope to elimiate or severly limit when using our application.

When a candidate is looking for a suitable project or when a project owner is looking for a suitable candidate, they will each be presented with a "Tinder-style" interface. Relevent details will be shared and the user will swipe right to express interest or swipe left to express disinterest.

Every user of the system will be required to fill out a survey that will be used to create the "Tinder-Style" view that the project owner will see. This view will indicate strength of matches for the project owners given criteria and will be used to decide if the project owner is interested in this candidate.

The system is designed to be used by skilled members of the public and project owners. For project owners, the system will augment and replace existing methods of finding skilled people, such as job banks and social networking communities such as LinkedIn. General users can view the list of projects and express interest in those that they would be like to join.

All persons who express interest in a project will be assigned a matchmaking score and those with the highest scores will be recommended to project owners. Project owners can then choose the person of their preference, and swipe to select users recommended to them or move on in their search. Users selected by a project owner will be notified of their selection immediately.

Since the system will be used primarily for matchmaking rather than project management, it does not need to support common project management features such as scheduling, reporting, and file sharing tools. It will, however, need to maintain a catalogue of all projects and the candidates and project owners who have been associated with every project in the past and present.

The use of a matchmaking system for skilled members of the public and project owners is an improvement over current systems as it provides an intuitive interface and the matchmaking format has proven to be successful for other domains. Because this system will be designed exclusively for matching people to projects, users will be able to more quickly find the people and projects that they want than using other social networking apps.

The system will be considered successful if both project owners and users prefer using this system over other networking tools, based on a survey given to people after demonstration of the system.
