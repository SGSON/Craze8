# Iteration 2 Retrospective
## Not as successful as we would have liked:
In the last iteration, we underestimated the amount of work required to finish up any last minute issues. The cause specifically was related to implementation of testing requirements compounded by erratic project velocity (underestimating time costs during planning). This resulted in what could only be described as a herculean effort by the entire team: a last minute, 5 hour long code sprint for the entire team, working on the final elements of the project (specifically testing). 
### The result:
* A tedious 5 hour long code sprint
* Unnecessary Stress
* Having to learn testing tools at the last minute (increasing likelihood of using it incorrectly)
* Handing in an iteration that we all felt we should have been better
* Negatively affecting other areas of the iteration requirements as we were “scramingling” last minute to complete the iteration  

We had assumed that we had everything under control and that when we met we would just put “finishing touches” on our iteration which included any test implementations that had not been completed.

## Determine concrete (and realistic) ways of improvement
### The team will attempt to take the following steps in the upcoming iteration:
* When planning for a feature and subsequence user stories/developer tasks:
    * Recognize that we are being overly-ambitious with amount of tasks we would like to get done properly in the time period provided.
    * An implemented feature, user story and developer task isn’t just the implementation in the application, it actually involves:
    * Writing unit, integration and system tests (which could involve learning and implementing new tools)
    * Merging the completed code into the correct branch(which carries a risk of not going smoothly. When it doesn’t go smoothly this can be very costly in terms of time needed to resolve the issue)
    * Troubleshooting of any general technical issues that may arise
* Ensure that all testing has an issue created in GitLab (so it does not get overlooked and to eliminate a false assumption that someone is working on that issue)
* Ensure that those issues have a due date that incorporates the potential time needed to deal with issues from point #1, as well a buffer to address any other unforeseen complications
* Ensure that those issues are assigned to one point-person to take the key responsibility for ensuring those tasks are done
* Book a specific time to review completed code that is at least one day before the iteration is due
* Decide how its success will be evaluated at the end of the iteration (measurable and objective)

## The team’s success for the above commitments in the upcoming iteration will be measured by the following criteria:
* Were the assigned issues in GitLab completed by the due dates? (Yes/No)
* Are the tests within the application written correctly and do all the tests pass? (Yes/No)
* Was everything we committed to, completed at least 1 day before the due date of the iteration? (Yes/No)
* An improvement in time estimated to complete the iteration vs actual time needed for the iteration (>=25%)
